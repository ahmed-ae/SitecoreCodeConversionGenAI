[![Sitecore JSS AI Code Generator](https://i.postimg.cc/T3SkLmJD/Sitecore-JSS-V0.png)](https://postimg.cc/Yv6NTvVr)
## 🚀 About The Project

This project is a revolutionary AI tool for Sitecore developers, leveraging the power of Generative AI to streamline the process of creating Sitecore JSS components. It offers two primary functionalities:

1. **Design-to-Code Conversion**: Transform any design, screenshot, or wireframe into a fully functional Sitecore JSS component (React/TypeScript) in seconds.

2. **Legacy Code Conversion**: Convert traditional Sitecore MVC or SXA Scriban components into modern Sitecore JSS components (React).

### Key Features

- 🎨 Convert designs to working Sitecore JSS components instantly
- 🔄 Real-time preview of generated components
- 💬 AI-powered chat for component customization
- 🔧 Legacy Sitecore code conversion
